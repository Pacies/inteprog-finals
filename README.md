Our team plans to create a simple Inventory Management System (IMS) with functinolaties like RBAC, CRUD, Sign-in/out features and more. 
In this IMS we focus on the raw materials that is comming into the system and the products that is inside the inventory.
Using RBAC means we are able to give users authority over other users. There would be 2 types of users in this system, first type of user is Admin, second is Employee.
An admin has control of the majority of the system, they will be able to use all features of the system like managing which user can add and delete records in either inventory and also be able to generate Inventory Reports. 
Unlike employees who are only give access to update and view the inventory.
